Introduction
=======================================
* This paper proposes a framework for inferring socio-demographic information using smart meter data
* Collecting household characteristics information and corresponding smart meter data requires considerable effort and cost
* We present a transfer learning methodology using datasets collected from different areas

Steps to Reproduce
==================
### Download raw dataset
Download following datasets  
`SAVE Dataset`: [link](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/doi/?id=8676#1)  
`CER Dataset`: [link](http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/)

Data location should be like belows
```
.
|- data
    |- raw # raw datasets downloaded
        |- CER
        |- SAVE
```

### Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare data from raw dataset
Make time series energy dataset and label
```
python prepare/cer_dataset.py
python prepare/save_dataset.py
```
From this process, we can get dataset in `data/prepared` like below.
```
.
|- data
    |- raw # raw datasets downloaded
        |- CER
        |- SAVE
    |- prepared # prepared dataset
        |- CER
            |- energy.csv
            |- info.csv
        |- SAVE
            |- energy.csv
            |- info.csv
```
energy.csv sample

```
`SAVE dataset`: 3938 households  
`CER dataset`: 3938 households

### Train and Evaluate
```
python main.py
```

Methodology
=======================================
![methodology](img/fig1.png)

### 1. Daily typical load generation
From time series dataset, get daily typical load by removing untypical sample
### 2. Instance selection
To prevent negative transfer remove instance which reduce similarity between two datasets by measuring [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence)
### 3. Feature selection
Extract influential features for both Source and Target datasets to remove noisy feature by [mrmr](https://pypi.org/project/pymrmr/)
### 4. Training
Train deep learning model with the source dataset
### 5. Fine tuning
Train the pre-trained model with target dataset
### 6. Testing
Infer test dataset with the rest of target dataset

Benchmarking
=======================================
Compare our methodology with benchmarking methodologys in the face of a shortage of datasets
